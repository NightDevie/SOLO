  description: 'The door slams violently behind you. There is a lit screen with words
    in it. There are two coffins, one is empty.

    Welcome again. You''re probably
    wondering what''s going on so I''m gonna tell you once more.

    The bad news
    is that your wife died in a car accident.

    The other bad news is that it
    was you who were driving. And the other bad news.. well.. Anyway..

    Right
    after, you were put in a dungeon loop, wiping your memories everytime.

    At
    the 1000th loop you will be freed and your old memories, as well as all the memories
    from each loop will be yours again.

    Hopefully you learn your lesson. Drive
    safe. Don''t be irresponsible. Don''t kill the two loves of your life. She was
    pregnant. YOUR BABY! ! !

    She was always there for you. She never left you
    alone. But now? Now.

    NOW I AM SOLO ! ! ! NOW YOU ARE SOLO ! ! ! NOW AND
    FOR ETERNITY ! ! !

    because you were irresponsible.. and..

    AND THERE''S
    NO GOING BACK ! ! !

    SHE''S DEAD ! ! !. . . THEY''RE DEAD ! ! ! . . sh.
    . she was a girl . . . my little child . .

    Yours sincerely, You.

    There''s
    a pedestal with a ring on it and one missing.'
