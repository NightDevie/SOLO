  description: 'Greetings! NightDevie here.

    A THOUSAND THANK YOUs for playing
    my game! And congratulations on finishing it!

    No.. I may or may not have
    already told you that there''s no more story after the 1000th loop, so.. don''t
    bother. Or keep going on forever if you wish.

    It will work properly.. surely,
    if you don''t manage to break it. I''ll make you a favor and let you keep your
    inventory.

    Yes that''s an excuse. Clearing your inventory had a bug so
    it''s not in the game yet. Hey I still didn''t sleep so.. don''t be harsh on
    me. UwU?

    Seriously, there''s no more story. I''m very honest. Maybe there
    are some things you didn''t find.. But you won''t find them by playing the game
    so don''t waste your time looping.

    

    Oh and remember, be responsible
    while there''s still time.

    

    So once more..

    You wake up in a
    dark, empty room wearing a backpack, this time it''s not empty, who knows why,
    right?.

    You feel tears going down your face, although you don''t remember
    anything(we gotta take care of that).'
